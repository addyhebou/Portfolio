<p id = "bio" style = "font-size: 100%;">Addy Stephane Hebou was born on December 16, 2000 in Cheverly, Maryland to Luc and Annick Hebou. With two younger siblings, Addy developed an interest in music after watching a Michael Jackson performance at the age of nine, perfecting Jackson's signature Moonwalk. He performed for several talent shows at his church and school, where in the latter he started to learn musical instruments, including the piano, drums, and guitar. In January 2010, Hebou introduced President Barack Obama to Metropolitan AME Church in Washington, DC on behalf of the church in honor of the Martin Luther Kind Jr. holiday. Hebou was a Boy Scout and Eagle Scout recipient. In 2018, he completed Scouting For Music, an Eagle Scout service project in which he colleged donated musical instruments across Maryland to donate to underpriviledged children. In addition to receiving instrument and monetary donations from across Maryland, he directed a benefit concert at his high school where his classmates and his own band, JustMusicians, performed to raise awareness and funds to refurbish the donated instruments, totaling to about forty. He graduated from North Point High School in 2018, Summa Cum Laude.</p>
